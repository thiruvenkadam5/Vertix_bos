    <h1>
        be good and be calm 
    </h1>
    <p>
         (Nothing good or bad can be done by others)
         Right now I am trying to be in a place of calm, a place where I can chill out and then handle the chaos of life better. ...
Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. ...
Be like a duck. ...
Calm mind brings inner strength and self-confidence, so that's very important for good health.
