    <h1>
        be good and be calm 
    </h1>
    <p>
         (Nothing good or bad can be done by others),
        (Be good to your enemies too), 
          (It is rarest to be born as a human),  (Every creature is equal at birth),
           and (The only use of wealth is to donate)
           Right now I am trying to be in a place of calm, a place where I can chill out and then handle the chaos of life better. ...
           Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. ...
           Be like a duck. ...
           Calm mind brings inner strength and self-confidence, so that's very important for good health.</p>
